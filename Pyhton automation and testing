Automation testing 
-----------------------------
1. Decrease cost and time of testing.
2. Enable continuous delivery through round the clock testing.
3. Ensure regression testing.
4. Increased the test coverage.
5. Cross device testing made- easy.

Layers of Test automation 
--------------------------------------
3. user interface tests
2. service/API layer tests
1. Unit tests

Unit tests
---------------------
It pinpoint bugs in code to level of line where it has occured. They are used to test small pieces of code and hence, 
can not be used for integration testing or system testing.

UI
----------
It is used to test only the functionality of the UI elements.

Service/API layer tests
---------------------------------
It tests the functionality in terms of services. A service is a function or an operatiuon that the application performs on some input
to produce an output.

The aim of service layer of testing is to seperate UI testing from functionality testing.

For unit testing and API testing, the python libraries unittest, pytest and nose provide support for UI level testing.
